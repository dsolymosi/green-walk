# Green Walk

A simple web app that shows parks within walking distance, using OSM data. The backend API is written in Go using Gin, and hosted on AWS Lambda. [Check it out!](https://dsolymosi.github.io/green-walk/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
